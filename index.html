    <h1>React vs Next.js</h1>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications. Next.js, on the other hand, is a React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation, enhancing Reactâ€™s capabilities. This article explores the differences, advantages, and use cases for both technologies.
    </p>
    
    <h2>What is React?</h2>
    <p>
        Developed by Facebook, React allows developers to create reusable UI components. Its core features include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Component-based architecture</li>
        <li>Virtual DOM for optimized rendering</li>
        <li>Unidirectional data flow</li>
        <li>Rich ecosystem with numerous libraries</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What is Next.js?</h2>
    <p>
        Next.js is a framework built on top of React, providing additional features that enhance performance and SEO. Key features include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Server-side rendering (SSR)</li>
        <li>Static site generation (SSG)</li>
        <li>API routes</li>
        <li>Built-in routing</li>
        <li>Automatic code splitting</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Differences</h2>
    <p>
        While React and Next.js share similarities, they serve different purposes. Here are some key differences:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Rendering:</strong> React primarily focuses on client-side rendering, whereas Next.js supports both server-side and static rendering.</li>
        <li><strong>Routing:</strong> React requires additional libraries for routing (like React Router), while Next.js has a built-in file-based routing system.</li>
        <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Next.js optimizes performance through features like automatic code splitting and pre-fetching.</li>
        <li><strong>SEO:</strong> Next.js provides better SEO capabilities due to server-side rendering, allowing search engines to crawl content more effectively.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>When to Use Each?</h2>
    <p>
        - Use <strong>React</strong> when building single-page applications where client-side rendering is sufficient, and you need more control over the architecture and routing.
    </p>
    <p>
        - Use <strong>Next.js</strong> for applications that require better SEO, faster performance through SSR, or when you want to create static sites with minimal configuration.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Both React and Next.js are powerful tools for web development. Choosing between them depends on the specific needs of your project. If you need a straightforward UI library, React is a great choice. For projects that require improved performance and SEO capabilities, Next.js is the way to go.
